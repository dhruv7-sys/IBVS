Introduction
The introduction section of the report provides a general overview of the project, its objectives, and the significance of the research conducted during the internship.

Robot Kinematics
This section delves into the fundamental concepts of robot kinematics, including:
•	Forward Kinematics: Calculating the pose of the end-effector from known joint variables using mathematical transformations.
•	Inverse Kinematics: Determining the joint parameters to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector.
•	Mechanism and Mobility: Explaining degrees of freedom (DOF), Grübler's Law, and the mobility of mechanisms.
•	End-Effectors and Robotic Arms: Discussing the design and control of grippers and manipulators, with different types of grippers (mechanical, vacuum, magnetic).

Aruco Markers
Aruco markers are fiducial markers used in computer vision for tasks like camera pose estimation and object tracking. The section covers:
•	Structure and Characteristics: Description of Aruco markers' design and internal binary patterns.
•	Applications: Various applications including camera calibration, pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module in IBVS
The ESP8266 module plays a crucial role in wireless communication for IBVS systems. This section includes:
•	Key Features: Wi-Fi connectivity, low power consumption, microcontroller integration, and programming flexibility.
